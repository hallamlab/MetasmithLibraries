"""CheckM2 (drop-in replacement for the original CheckM v1 transform).

Public surface — model name, dtype produced (taxonomy::checkm_stats), and the
per-genome TSV shape consumed by the aggregator — is unchanged. Internals
swapped to `checkm2 predict`; the CheckM2 DiamondDB is baked into the image
and exposed via CHECKM2DB, so no --database_path is needed.

The aggregator (_parse_checkm) joins on a "Bin Id" column. CheckM2's
quality_report.tsv calls that column "Name"; we rename it on emit.

v1.1.0 prodigal robustness
--------------------------

CheckM2 v1.1.0 has a pyrodigal-gv heap bug (GitHub issue #149) that aborts
the WHOLE batch when one bin trips it: the shared per-batch FAA gets
truncated mid-write, DIAMOND fails on every bin downstream, and the entire
N-bin batch is reported as FAILED. We hit this on the spanish-lakes W3 run
(see SG20W5.comebin.185 / SG3X12.* / SG4E23.* / SG6W12.* / SG9E22.*).

The workaround here is two-stage:
  1. Call `prodigal -p meta` per-bin in an isolated subprocess so a heap
     abort kills only that one call. The other bins' FAAs are written
     before the bad bin even gets touched.
  2. Hand the surviving FAAs to CheckM2 in `--genes` mode — which skips
     prodigal entirely and just runs the batched DIAMOND step where the
     wall-clock actually is.
Bins whose prodigal call aborted (or whose DIAMOND pass returns zero hits)
get a sentinel row with Completeness=0/Contamination=0 and an
Additional_Notes explanation, instead of taking the whole batch down.

# TODO(dag-level fix): the structurally cleaner answer is to add a
# per-bin protein FAA as an upstream product and have the W3 binning
# DAG feed it into this transform — the W2 prodigal step
# (metagenomics/assembly/orfs/<SG>.faa) has already run successfully
# for every sample by the time binning starts, so the heap bug is
# entirely out-of-loop. That requires a new product type
# (e.g. `sequences::per_bin_faa`), a small transform that subsets the
# per-sample FAA by each bin's contig set, and an extra requirement on
# this model. Best done during the next W3 redesign rather than retrofit
# now. Until then, the in-transform isolation below is the workaround.
