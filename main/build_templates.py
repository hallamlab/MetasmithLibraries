"""Author every template in this directory, and fail naming the ones that broke.

`./dev.sh -b` runs this after rebuilding the `_metadata/`, which is what makes a
template a tested artifact rather than a stale example: the solve is the
assertion, and a transform whose products changed shape takes the templates that
depend on it down with it, by name, at build time.

A template author is a module here defining `NAME`, `DESCRIPTION` and
`build_spec`; they are listed below rather than discovered, because the rest of
this directory is run drivers that talk to real clusters on import and must not
be swept up by a build.
